Makes hidden custom fields (post meta) visible on the post edit screen

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that will make hidden post meta (also known as custom fields) visible on the post edit screen. There is an older plugin called [Show Hidden Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/show-hidden-custom-fields/) which has been abandoned by its author and no longer works since WordPress 3.2, so this plugin was developed to take its place.

== Installation ==

If you know what custom fields are and why you want to show hidden ones, it is assumed that you also know how to install a plugin.

There are no settings pages or configuration options; simply install and activate the plugin and all hidden custom fields will be made visible.
